This is **Royal Oak Arboriculture**.

The video shows a very green, nature-focused design. To sell this for £3k+, we need to pivot away from "Tree Lopping" (which sounds destructive) to **"Arboricultural Management"** (which sounds scientific and essential).

The client for this site isn't just someone who wants a bush trimmed; it's a homeowner with a 100-year-old Oak tree that is protected by a council order, or a commercial site needing a safety survey.

### The Persona: "The Guardian of the Canopy"
* **Tone:** Knowledgeable, safe, eco-conscious, and precise.
* **The Pitch:** We don't just cut trees; we manage living assets. We navigate the legal paperwork (TPOs) and the physical danger so you don't have to.
* **Target Audience:** Estate owners, councils, and homeowners with large, mature gardens in London.

Here is the homepage copy for **Royal Oak**.

### 2. Philosophy Section (Arborists vs. Loggers)
*The video has a header "Professional Arboriculture". Let's fill that space with authority.*

**Headline:**
**We Are Arborists, Not Just Cutters.**

**Body:**
Trees are valuable assets. Poor pruning can kill a tree or make it dangerous. At Royal Oak, we understand tree biology. We assess the health, structure, and species of every tree before we make a cut, ensuring we leave your garden safer and more beautiful than we found it.

### 3. Services Section (The Technical Skills)
*We need to highlight the "difficult" stuff that justifies high prices.*

**Headline:**
**Precision Tree Management**

* **Crown Reduction & Thinning:**
    Scientifically reducing the canopy size to allow more light into your garden while maintaining the tree's natural shape and health.
* **Sectional Felling (Rigging):**
    Removing dangerous trees in confined spaces. We use advanced lowering devices (rigging) to bring heavy timber down safely without damaging your fences or flowerbeds.
* **Stump Grinding & Removal:**
    Don't let an old stump ruin your lawn. Our narrow-access grinders chew stumps down to 30cm below ground level, ready for replanting.

### 4. The "Paperwork" Section (The Admin Hook)
*This is the killer feature for selling the website. TPOs (Tree Preservation Orders) are a nightmare for clients. You are selling the solution.*

**Headline:**
**We Handle the Council for You**

**Body:**
Living in a Conservation Area? Does your tree have a TPO? Don't risk a £20,000 fine.
* **Checks:** We check the legal status of your trees before booking any work.
* **Applications:** We submit the planning applications to the local authority on your behalf.
* **Compliance:** All work is carried out strictly in accordance with approved specifications.

*(Pitching tip: Tell the Tree Surgeon, "My website collects the postcode and prompts you to check for TPOs automatically. It stops you getting sued.")*

### 5. Testimonials (The "Cleanliness" Angle)
*Homeowners are terrified of mess. These reviews calm that fear.*

**Headline:**
**Leaving Your Garden Spotless**

> **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Watching them work was like a ballet."**
> "We had a huge Ash tree taken down over our greenhouse. The team used ropes to lower every branch. Nothing was damaged, and they even swept the driveway."
> — *The Harrison Family, Richmond*

> **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "They saved our Oak tree."**
> "Another company wanted to chop it down. Royal Oak suggested a crown thin and dead-wooding. The tree looks healthier than ever and we get to keep our shade."
> — *Mr. T. Clarke, Wimbledon*

### 6. The Process (Safety First)
*The video shows "Consultation -> Fixed Quote -> Execution". Let's tweak it for safety.*

**Headline:**
**Safety Standards You Can Rely On**

1.  **Site Survey:** We assess the tree's health and any targets (buildings/glass) below.
2.  **Risk Assessment:** You receive a fixed quote and a method statement detailing how we will do the job safely.
3.  **The Climb:** Our NPTC-certified climbers carry out the work using modern rope access techniques.
4.  **Green Disposal:** We chip the brushwood into our truck and blow/rake your garden clean.
